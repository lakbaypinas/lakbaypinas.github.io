              <p> When asked what's the most beautiful attraction to see in Romblon, locals would point to Crest De Gallo. A five-hectare kidney-shaped islet located east of Sibuyan Island. Known for its picturesque views, powder white sands and turquoise waters. The island is almost secluded except for one fisher family living there.

              <p>The Looc Bay Marine Sanctuary is a protected marine sanctuary in the middle of Looc Bay. It is host to more than a hundred different marine species including different fishes, corals, clams, lobsters, and turtles.It's one of my most recommended activities when in Tablas! Adults and kids alike will enjoy swimming, snorkeling, and feeding the fishes.For those who don't enjoy swimming, the floating house features a clear open aquarium at the center where you can feed the fish.</p>

              <p>Considered as Romblon's best and probably most beautiful sandbar.Located just 5km away from Romblon town, the beach is a must-go-to-site when visiting the island, with frequent locals and foreigner visitors alike. Besides its beautiful 2km stretch sand, it's unique feature is that it connects all the way to uninhabited Bang-ug island.</p>

          <p>Romblon is known as the “Marble Country” due to its bountiful deposits of marble, which are mainly used in construction and sculpture. In fact, it is believed that the substructures of the islands are made of marble.Way back in 1900’s, mining in Romblon started. However, it was only after World War II that the importance of marble was given due attention and introduction to the market. With various lively colors combined with the intricate natural art lines and shades. Romblon’s marble easily transforms into an exotic material that is suitable and attractive for the construction industry. Proudly saying, this province is the only place in Southeast Asia with such rich marble deposits that are of commercial value which are said to be equal in quality to Italian marbles. Now with the computerized cutting tools and sophisticated polishing machines from Italy, the consumers are well assured of precision and high quality marble tiles.</p>

          <p>The Fiesta Executive Committee of 2010 thought of having a festival to praise and thank the Lord for some of the agricultural  sources of livelihood of the people in the municipality. The Banana and Coconut plants which are considered versatile in most Barangays were chosen to be the focus of  the festival for these plants have many uses. The organizers also took into account some of the positive factors that could help people give importance to these plants. The people must be motivated towards an awareness that saging and niyog could be a big contribution to enhance their living conditions especially, the farmers. Through a festival we could also awaken the people to use their skills in making use of the different parts of these plants.</p>

          <p> Sihi, a local edible shellfish. One cannot normally eat by sucking it out of its shell, but instead, with an aid of a pin, you slowly pick the meat out.
When fishermen aren’t able to get a good catch of fish for the day, they would often resort to looking for these shells by the shore.
Often cooked in coconut milk, you can find them in carinderias in Looc Town.</p>
