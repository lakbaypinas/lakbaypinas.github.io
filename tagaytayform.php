              <p>Located on top of Mt. Sungay, the highest peak in Cavite, People’s Park was part of a mansion commissioned by the former First Lady Imelda Marcos. In 1981 it was originally called the Palace in the Sky but with the downfall of Marcos in 1986, the mansion was left unfinished. It was then opened to the public as a park. Every time I go to the park I am amazed at the panoramic view  of Batangas, Laguna, Cavite and even Metro Manila on a clear day. Try visiting the park after dark to see the lights of the Tagaytay City and SLEX.</p>

          <p> Bulalo is a Filipino stew made from beef shanks and marrow bones. Bulalo is a light colored soup that’s made rich by cooking beef shanks and beef marrow bones for hours, until much of the collagen and fat has melted into the clear broth. The seasonings vary from chef to chef with some using only salt and black pepper while other variations call for patis, bay leaves or even garlic. But at its core, Bulalo a simple cattleman’s stew, best made in a large cauldron with whatever veggies are growing near by.</p>

          <p> One unique festival in the islands is the Pilipinyahan showcasing the wide range of dishes Filipinos can cook out of pineapple such as the pininyahang manok (chicken cooked with pineapple chunks and pineapple juice). It is usually celebrated during the first week of May. Of course, the fiesta, as Filipino call their festivals, normally include street dancing and warm smiles contrasting the cool climate of Tagaytay. But the interesting element of the festival is how Caviteños creatively and diligently conceptualize their yearly parade of majestic pineapple-inspired floats. Come to Tagaytay, not just to experience the lively festivities Caviteños have to offer and THE city’s cool weather, but also to let your senses be filled with the inviting aroma of pineapple dishes prepared to make your mouths water with appetite!
