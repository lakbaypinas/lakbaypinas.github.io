The festival is considered to be first of most popular festivals in the Philippines, with every celebration of the festival routinely attracting around 1 to 2 million people from all over the Philippines every year.Aside from the religious aspect of the festival, Sinulog is also famous for its street parties, usually happening the night before and the night of the main festival.

          <p> Cebu is known for its danggit which is a salted, sun-dried rabbitfish (a.k.a. spinefoot), which are abundant and native to the island’s shallower waters. The fish are split open, cleaned, salted, and spread out on drying racks under the sun. Danggit is popular among locals as breakfast food, fried and paired with eggs, rice, and atsara (pickled unripe papaya), with a vinegar and chili dip on the side. The smell of fried dried fish first thing in the morning might be off-putting to some, but judging by its popularity as pasalubong gifts to hand out after a trip), Cebuanos love waking up to the pungent, sea-salty crunch of danggit.</p>
