              <p> The fort was founded in 1635 as a garrison during the Spanish era and now serves as a shrine and an important historical landmark in Zamboanga City. The place also houses a National Museum branch inside that exhibits paintings, natural marine life and cultural memorabilia that represents the bygone era of Zamboanga as a Spanish City.</p>

The park is very beautiful and a good place to go to if you just want to take a walk and enjoy the atmosphere of the park.</p>

          <p>This paklay recipe is simple and straightforward. For those that are not familiar with this dish, paklay is a stew made-up of pig and cow innards. This dish is popular in the southern parts of the Philippines and is best enjoyed as a main dish or as pulutan. Although it might seem that it needs an acquired taste to enjoy this dish, I must confess that I fell in love with paklay the moment I tried it —  and it became a habit to cook paklay when I have the chance.</p>

          <p>The Regatta de Zamboanga happened only during October but the Badjaos always took pains in having year-long preparations for the event. Men worked hard in carving their own boat or lepa-lepa, making sure that it was watertight and that the balance was just right. When the boats were done, local shamans performed rituals for the vessel to have a spirit that would guide it in the waters. The weavers made sure that the sails—those of vertical bands and intricate patterns of bright colors—for the vintas were as beautiful as the jeweled Regatta dancers themselves. Beauticians would extract fruit juices, wait until many full moons and mix them with dried leaves to produce paint for the dancers’ faces. And the dancers—those young maidens who were a picture of innocent sensuality—woke up before sunup each day to dance to the waves.</p>
