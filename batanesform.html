              <p>Heading to the hills you would pass by a viewdeck on a steep mountainside where the cliff meets the sea. From the south of the capital on the way to Mahatao, you can easily see the viewdeck with a grotto of the Virgin Mary and few stone benches where you can photoshoot and admire the view. Since it faces the South China Sea, this spot is ideal for sunset watching. From the viewdeck, you can descend to more than a hundred zigzagging steps leading to a small rocky coast below where you can find naturally made pools. Climbing back up is not for the faint of knees though.</p>

              <h1 style="font-size:20px; font-weight:bold">2) Marlboro Country/ Racuh A Payaman</h1>
        
              <p>Get your “The Sound of Music” game on and head to Uyugan to check one of the popular place for tourists to marvel the scenery and for livestock to graze at. Seriously, when you reach the rolling hills of Uyugan you will fight the urge to either 1. do a selfie 2. take a jumpshot 3. sing Julie Andrews “The Hills are Alive” or do all of them! Marvel the spectacular panorama of hills and hedgerows and slopes and mountains and sea as you listen to the gentle song of the wind. The image in your head surely will linger for days, months, even years to come. One interesting fact: Each family can only have up to ten cows to freely roam in the pasture. A limit is imposed to prevent overgrazing. In return for use of the land, family members of the livestock owners must help out in community activities such as building houses, maintaining the hedgerows around the land and other cooperative works.</p>

              <p> Another view deck you should not miss is the Mahatao. Going to Marlboro country, you can head to the viewdeck. You cannot miss it as it is the stop leading to the hills. You can also arrange to have lunch here and your stomach and eyes will surely be full with Ivatan cuisine and scenery. This is also where one of the lighthouse of Batanes is situated – the Tayid Lighthouse.</p>

              <p>Batanes has three lighthouses. The construction of three lighthouses around Batanes was a project of then Congressman Florencio Abad in the early 2000′s. These parolas were built not only to guide seafarers across the treacherous waters of the Pacific Ocean and West Philippine Sea (South China Sea), but also as tourist attractions. All three lighthouses are open to visitors anytime, accentuating the vista with their magnificent and imposing presence.</p>

          <p>A vakul is a headgear designed to protect the wearer from sun and rain. It is made from abaca fiber of the vuyavuy palm. The Ivatan have three different folk songs: the laji, the kanta and the kalusan. The vakul has, deservingly, become an image synonymous with Batanes. It is not only something the looks unique, completing the romance of the rolling hills of Batanes. Beyond that, it exemplifies the spirit of the Ivatan. Every detail of their lives is centered around survival. From drying fish so that they may have food to eat when the waves become too treacherous, to building houses of solid stone that can stand up to the fiercest of storms. The vakul likewise reflects a simplicity and beauty valued in the life of the Ivatans, a place where traditions are kept sacred, largely unspoiled by technology and commercialism.</p>

          <p>The tree, known as Arius (Podocarpus costalis), is an endemic in Batanes. It serves as an excellent ornamental tree often used by the Ivatans as a  Christmas tree during the Yuletide season. With  fruit-based wines progressively carving their niche in the beverage market, the BSC has  joined numerous product trade fairs and exhibits to market test Arius products – especially the wine. Based on the results, Arius wine passed the standards of a fruit-based wine. </p>
